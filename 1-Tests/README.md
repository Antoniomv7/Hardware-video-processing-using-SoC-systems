# Tests: Preliminary Tests

This section focuses on the preliminary tests conducted on the PYNQ-Z2 board for video processing. It follows the detailed steps provided in section 3 "Pruebas Preliminares" from the accompanying PDF document "Memoria".

## Overview

In this section, you will learn how to:
- Set up the development environment.
- Conduct initial tests on the PYNQ-Z2 board.
- Validate the setup and functionality of the hardware and software components.

## Prerequisites

- PYNQ-Z2 board
- Vivado Design Suite
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of FPGA design and video processing

## Steps

### 1. Development Environment Setup
- **Install Necessary Tools**: Ensure Vivado Design Suite and other required tools are installed on your computer.
- **Board Setup**: Connect the PYNQ-Z2 board to your computer and configure it according to the instructions provided in the PDF.

### 2. Initial Tests
- **LED and Switch Test**: Verify the basic functionality of LEDs and switches on the PYNQ-Z2 board. Write and deploy a simple design to control the LEDs using the switches.
- **HDMI Output Test**: Set up and test the HDMI output to ensure video signals are correctly processed and displayed.

### 3. Design and Simulation
- **Basic Design Implementation**: Implement a basic design in Vivado to familiarize yourself with the tool and the PYNQ-Z2 board. This could include simple video processing tasks.
- **Simulation and Verification**: Simulate the design to verify its functionality before deploying it to the hardware.

### 4. Deploy and Validate
- **Bitstream Generation**: Generate the bitstream file from your design in Vivado.
- **Programming the FPGA**: Load the bitstream onto the PYNQ-Z2 board and validate the functionality through hardware tests.
