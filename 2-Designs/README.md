# Designs: Software and Hardware Tests

This section focuses on both software and hardware tests conducted on the PYNQ-Z2 board for video processing. It follows the detailed steps provided in sections 4 "Pruebas Software" and 5 "Pruebas Hardware" from the accompanying PDF document "Memoria".

## Overview

In this section, you will learn how to:
- Conduct software-based tests for video processing.
- Implement and test hardware designs on the PYNQ-Z2 board.
- Compare the performance and efficiency of software and hardware implementations.

## Prerequisites

- PYNQ-Z2 board
- Vivado Design Suite and Vitis HLS
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of C/C++ programming, Verilog/VHDL and Python
- Familiarity with FPGA design and video processing

## Sections

### 1. Software Tests (Pruebas Software)

#### 1.1 Development Environment Setup
- **Install Necessary Tools**: Ensure Vivado Design Suite, Vitis HLS, and other required tools are installed on your computer.
- **Board Setup**: Connect the PYNQ-Z2 board to your computer and configure it according to the instructions provided in the PDF.

#### 1.2 Implementing Video Filters
- **Negative Filter**: Develop and implement a negative filter in software. Test and validate its functionality.
- **Sepia Filter**: Develop and implement a sepia filter. Test and validate its functionality.
- **Sobel Edge Detection**: Implement the Sobel edge detection filter and verify its performance.

#### 1.3 Performance Analysis
- **Testing**: Test each filter with sample video data.
- **Analysis**: Analyze the performance of each filter in terms of processing speed and resource usage.

### 2. Hardware Tests (Pruebas Hardware)

#### 2.1 Development of Video Filters in Vitis HLS
- **Design and Optimization**: Use Vitis HLS to design and optimize video filters for hardware implementation.
- **Validation**: Validate the design through simulation in Vitis HLS.

#### 2.2 Integration in Vivado
- **Import IP Cores**: Import the designed IP cores into a Vivado project.
- **System Integration**: Integrate the IP cores with other system components in Vivado.
- **Synthesis and Implementation**: Synthesize and implement the design in Vivado.

#### 2.3 Deployment and Testing
- **Bitstream Generation**: Generate the bitstream file from the Vivado project.
- **Programming the FPGA**: Load the bitstream onto the PYNQ-Z2 board.
- **Validation**: Test the hardware implementation of the video filters to ensure they work as expected.

#### 2.4 Performance Evaluation
- **Comparison with Software**: Compare the performance of hardware and software implementations in terms of speed, efficiency, and resource usage.
- **Optimization**: Identify areas for optimization in the hardware design to improve performance.
