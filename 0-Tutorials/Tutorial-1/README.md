# Tutorial 1: Fun with LEDs and Switches

This tutorial introduces basic concepts and practices for working with SoC systems, specifically using LEDs and switches on the PYNQ-Z2 board. It is based on the guide by Umer Farooq.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
- Set up your PYNQ-Z2 board.
- Write simple hardware description language (HDL) code to control LEDs and read switch states.
- Deploy and test your design on the hardware.

## Prerequisites

- PYNQ-Z2 board
- Vivado Design Suite
- Basic knowledge of Verilog or VHDL
- Familiarity with FPGA design flow

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Your Board:**
   - Connect the PYNQ-Z2 board to your computer.
   - Install necessary drivers and software tools.

2. **Write HDL Code:**
   - Create a new project in Vivado.
   - Write Verilog or VHDL code to control LEDs and read from switches.
   - Synthesize and implement your design.

3. **Deploy and Test:**
   - Generate the bitstream.
   - Load the bitstream onto the PYNQ-Z2 board.
   - Test the functionality of LEDs and switches.
