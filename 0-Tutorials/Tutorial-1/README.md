# Tutorial 1: Fun with LEDs and Switches

This tutorial introduces basic concepts and practices for working with SoC systems, specifically using LEDs and switches on the PYNQ-Z2 board. It follows the detailed steps provided in the accompanying PDF document.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
- Set up your PYNQ-Z2 board.
- Write simple Python code to control LEDs and read switch states.

## Prerequisites

- PYNQ-Z2 board
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of Python

## Steps

### 1. Set Up Your Board
- **Required Elements**: PYNQ-Z2 board, micro-SD card, Ethernet cable, micro-USB cable, external micro-SD card reader.
- **Prepare the micro-SD card**: Download the PYNQ image from the [official website](http://www.pynq.io/board.html), write it to the micro-SD card using a tool like [Win32 Disk Imager](https://win32diskimager.download/).

### 2. Configure the Board
- **Power and Connectivity**: Insert the micro-SD card into the board, connect the board to your computer using the micro-USB cable, and optionally connect the Ethernet cable for internet access.

### 3. Interacting with Jupyter
- **Access Jupyter Notebook**: Open a web browser and connect to the board's IP address to access Jupyter Notebook. Use the default credentials (`xilinx` for both username and password).

### 4. Example: Blinking LEDs
- **Write Python Code**: Use the Jupyter Notebook to write Python code that interacts with the PYNQ-Z2 board. Example code to control LEDs using switches is provided in the PDF.
