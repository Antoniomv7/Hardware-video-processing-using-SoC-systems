# Hardware Video Processing using SoC Systems

This project focuses on implementing video processing algorithms using System on Chip (SoC) systems. The goal is to leverage the compact, energy-efficient, and high-performance capabilities of SoC systems to enhance real-time video processing.

## Overview

The project showcases the advantages of using SoC systems for video processing tasks, including improved energy efficiency and processing performance compared to traditional hardware. Various algorithms and their implementations are evaluated to demonstrate these benefits.

## Features

- Real-time video processing
- Energy-efficient design
- High-performance computing with SoC systems
- Evaluation of different video processing algorithms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with this project, you need the following:

- An SoC platform (e.g., Xilinx Zynq, Intel Cyclone V SoC)
- Vivado Design Suite
- SDK for software development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Antoniomv7/Hardware-video-processing-using-SoC-systems.git
   cd Hardware-video-processing-using-SoC-systems
   ```

2. Open the Vivado project and generate the bitstream:
   ```bash
   vivado -source project.tcl
   ```

3. Export the hardware to SDK and create a new application project for the software part.

## Usage

1. Load the bitstream onto the SoC hardware.
2. Compile and run the software application in the SDK.
3. Connect the video input source to the SoC system.
4. Monitor the processed video output.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the hardware design.
- `sdk/`: Contains the software projects for SDK.
- `docs/`: Documentation and reports related to the project.
